## Step 1: Brainstorming

Hub+Weber Architects is a six-architect team based in Covington, Kentucky. The website had not been updated since 2003, so the main priority of 2013 was redesigning and updating the website. 

I facilitated a meeting with the owner, in-house graphic designer, and student intern to discuss goals and needs. My main question to answer during this meeting was: **what is Hub+Weber's dynamic content?**

The initial reaction was the traditional visual-type response architects give, which is showcasing their portfolio. However, with this being a small firm targeting HUD and local government projects, the firm only produced enough for a new portfolio sample every two to three months. 

To drive the meeting forward, I had us complete a SWOT Analysis:

This pointed out that each person at the firm was actively engaged in nonprofits around the city. 

## Step 2: User Research + Persona

Since part of this involvement in local nonprofits included their target audience, I created two personas based on interviews and surveys conducted and different local events. This is when I had the developed an engagement strategy to showcase how Hub+Weber were Covington's architects. 

I knew we needed to add a section to include 3rd party information, including local nonprofits and city events. The team was not convinced this was a great idea, however, so to prototyping I went. 

## Step 3: Low-Fidelity Prototype 

I started with mapping out the current website's structure, included a home page, about us, portfolio, and contact. To infuse the engagement strategy throughout the entire website, I recommended:

• Add a map on the portfolio page to showcase local activity

• Add a community page with intergrated social media to highlight local networks and nonprofits

• Focus attention on high-resolution photography

## Step 4: Incorporating Feedback + Development

After several revisions and UI discussions, I developed a high-fidelity, interactive prototype to demonstrate proof of concept. It was also at this point that we began the talking about the beta-user testing process, and how to test different design ideas that were in debate within the team. 

During these meetings, I had an idea to include personal tid-bit information for each of the architects and include community involvement in some way on every page. We were having difficulty obtaining high-resolution content, and I recommended using more personable language throughout the site instead of waiting for professional photography to dictate the brand. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/99489891-1120-4789-8062-b76a132286f4.jpg)

## Results

The new community section became an instant hit. Hub + Weber was already recognized as a community leader in involvement, dedication, and investment and this section made this small architecture firm the go-to choice for local officials. Based on user testing and Google Analytics, we saw an increase of 213% of repeat visitors, 31% increase in local networking turnouts hosted by Hub + Weber, and 18% increase in Request for Proposal submission requests.
