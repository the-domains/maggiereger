# Irvine Company: Interactive CMS Design

Information architecture, user experience research, interactive design, user experience design, content strategy, custom CMS

_Tools:_ XML, SVG, Photoshop, Google Sheets, Illustrator, Omnigraffle

_Team:_ Product Development (Software)

## Step 1: Discovery

The Irvine Company was a top client at Engrain that encorporated three separate organizations: Apartments, Homes, and Commercial. I was assigned to redesign the custom built CMS (using PHP). I facilitated a stakeholder meeting with the client in order to establish priorities.

**Main Issues:** Slow turn-around time, duplicate steps in content management, and confusing instructions

**Target Audience:** On-site sales team, corporate administrators

## Step 2: Analysis of Current Flow

Though the CMS was built as needed for three separate departments' needs, there was an established area that housed content that was shared throughout the company, like locations. From that, I was able to see that each department was standard, though each had specific considerations in regards to third party and types of content provided from the independent properties. I also found that the same image or link would need to be updated into three or sometimes as many as eight different locations within the CMS, which often led to random images being missing on an iPad or mobile device.

**Main Priorities: **Streamline cross-functional content workflow and allow for shared content across departments while maintaining independent standards

## Step 3: Information Architecture

While using task-based scenarios, I used index cards and sticky notes to plan out the main structure. This process eliminated a lot of my initial organizational ideas. I had the A-HA! moment when I realized how global content was, which allowed me to streamline the process. I grouped all the content that was shared between the departments and then standardized each section with a list of requirements.

## Step 4:  Content Strategy

We brought the client in at this point to ask for feedback. I provided Irvine with a list of content requirements and specifications that encompassed every department. This was the basis for the training guide.

## Step 5: Medium-Fidelity Prototype 

After the client approved the content strategy, I developed a medium-fidelity prototype for the developers and designers. Once the Account Manager again had approval, I was able to manage the production process.

## Step 6: Documentation and Training

After my recommendations were implemented in their custom built CMS, we saw an immediate and sustained drop in bug reports from the Irvine Company (79%) and an even stronger response rate to providing usability feedback (88% response rate).

This process also allowed for a faster deployment time of all software by 15% over the quarter.
